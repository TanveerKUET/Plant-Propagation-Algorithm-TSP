Implementation of Travelling Salesman Problem using Plant Propagation Algorithm

Strawberry Plant Propagation
There are three main ways to propagate
strawberry plants
* The plants can be divided and
transplanted once multiple crowns have
been grown (or division of rhizomes)
* new plants can be grown from
strawberry seeds
* or the runners that strawberry plants
put out can be controlled, guided, and
caused to root where clone plants can
be utilized most efficiently.

* The strawberry plant, for instance, has a
survival and expansion strategy
Send short runners
  exploit local area
if the latter has good conditions
Send send long runners
  explore new and more remote areas
i.e. to run away from a not so favorable current area
